          <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
    <p>Our mision here at the Loudonville Foundation is to provide the Homeless of Loudonville with 
        3 gourmet meals a day. We aim to give our customers the best top quality meats and veggetables 
        sourced from local farms. All meals are paired with an IPA or wine of their choice.
        <p>The Loudonville Foundation is the little sister of a Califronia Flagship charity "Food for the Homeless of 
            Beverly Hills."
            Started in 1984 by a Detroit detective named Axel Foley who donated $200.00 in the name of Sydney Berstien a man 
            who became homeless after his ex-wife left him with many unpaid parking tickets. It wasn't untill
            1986 when the Whitemens a rich family in Beverly Hills saved a vegrant named Jerry Baskins from drowning in their pool.
        <p>It was then that the Whitemen's decided to donate millions to the less fortunates of Beverly Hills.
        <p>The Loudonville Foundations vision is to leave a never ending impresssion on our customers. 
            An impression of innovation, creativity, and originality.</p>
